   Check the first section, that should be enough. 

2) at the root of cornac folder, run this command : 
bin/cornac -I <ini>

3) Stand by ... some time. 

4) When cornac says 'Done' : 
 a) go in your destination directory, HTML version will be there, starting with index.html
 b) link (ln -s) you web root to the 'web' directory in cornac, and then,
    point your browser to the good path (http://localhost/web) : 
    All should be there
 c) Run bin/inventory -I <ini> and open the resulting .ods with Open Office
