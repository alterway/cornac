Spot php error during execution, and report it. 
Could it be possible to chain results? Atm, one can do it manually, or creating a new analyzer

Gather analyzers by type : function/method, class, file, overall (global) : we can then adapt output, and also, decide if a change in code impact this analyzer. 

Add options for auditeurs analyzers (.ini for the main, or sqlite's db, and also dictionnaries)

Export from auditeur to other format (PDF, HTML, XML, JSON, CSV, SQLITE, ODT...)

Standardization : display one groupe, another, its intersection. Should we build be able to combine the reports as groups (intersect, union, etc.) between report? Then add counting system (group by, vent by file...).

Prepare auditeur for wordpress, joomla, drupal, sf, zf, ci. 

[analysers ideas]
spot method that do not use $this (property or method). 
Suggest moving public to private, based on method usage (within or outside).

Make a tree with view calling each other (that coud word on controllers too, and models). 
CHeck for calls between controlers/models/view!  (This shouldn't happen...)

Make a tree with exceptions throws (List des émetteur d'exception, et de leur catch)

check that variables are constante (only received a constant value).

Spot special advice in the PHP doc (like warning in the strpos doc) and make an analyzer for them
   http://php.net/manual/en/domdocument.load.php 
Spot integer not in decimal format
Spot invalid integer in different format (octal, hexa...)
Spot typecasting of integer in operations.

Classes relations based on class constant.

return out of functions scope
Spot redeclared methods in class hierarchy
Spot type of value returned by method/functions
(then start identifying types of variables/properties, including the mixed one). 

spot affectations out of place (in if, as argument...)

identify 'tainted' values (either from GPC, or from arguments)
identify returned values (used in return)
identify tainted function (one that return transformed incoming values)
identify variable class by method/property/constant usage. 

Make a function call tree (which function calls which)

add 'variable' as a scope, so that we can actually work context by context

affected only variables (not used anywhere else that affectations)

String by delimiter (especially <<< )

detect impossible condition (if (false), ...)

PHP configuration function usage

uninitialised variables (first to be used in a function/main).

Long functions (number of tokens, number of lines...), 
Compromised variables (the one affected with values from GPC)

Gather files including something else than class, function or global.... 
undefined properties used (in class) : must support hierarchy too.

Note variable type, when it is possible (intval, new, etc...)

List of type variable we might guess.
Variable that never gets affected (is this register_globals?)
Long list of parameters (called or defined...)
Long list of public methods

List open-ended inclusions (including files that we don't know about)

Report of dependance of a method : local variables, global ones, class, constantes, statique. 

Detect multiple definitions of functions/classes (things that should be there only once : how can we process that then?)
Detect missing elements in classes (like methods, properties, etc)
Make a array of function (are they defined? at what level?)

Be able to search for a string, whatever the analyzer (intersect analyzers result and see what is is common)

functions (and files) that emit text (print, var_dump, raw text...)
functions (and files) that emit error (join, mysql_connect, ) : they should be checked...

methods/files/classes that misses some (provided) code.

Check that above characteristics are at the right place (by folder, by framework...)

Support some framework : drupal, joomla, zend, symfony, magento
    Support for : templating, modele, controler, usage of internals recommanded libraries

htmlentities used without encoding information

Spot function declaration in the middle of nowhere

Suggest gathering code, depending on calling graph (a->b, b->c, so a,b,c should be a class by itself)

List des variables dans les vues
différences entre les variables de vue et de controleur

check for proxy classes : X methods call their parent methods
